## hack Progress
* If your device is rooted, I highly recommend using [U.R.C](https://github.com/JMBQ/URC). It works well and is safe compared to the menu mod
* If your device is not rooted, I recommend using a virtual app that enables Zygisk, which is present in the CN environment
* MENU MOD 6.7.0 update, im coming


## Features
* Available for this servers, including SEA, GLOBAL, JP, KR, TW, VN
* Android 64-bit phones, no root required
* Compatible with arm64-v8a architecture
* Support for bypassing normal signature checks
* Dynamic capture function offset for current and future versions of the game
* No ads
  
  

## Cautions
* The first time you run the game, you will jump to the hover permission screen under normal circumstances
* Crash just after opening the game
  * Occasional crashes just after opening are normal
  * Crash just after opening several times in a row This is not normal, check for incorrect operation

## Finally
* If your phone is unlocked for bootloader, you can use [U.R.C](https://github.com/JMBQ/URC) for all servers
