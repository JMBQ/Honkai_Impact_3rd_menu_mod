## suggestion
* If your device is rooted, I highly recommend using [U.R.C](https://github.com/JMBQ/URC). It works well and is safe compared to the menu mod


## MENU APK
* Continuously updated：[click here](MENU_MOD_APK.md)


## Features
* Android 64-bit phones, no root required
* Compatible with arm64-v8a architecture
* Support for bypassing normal signature checks
* No ads

## Cautions
* The first time you run the game, you will jump to the hover permission screen under normal circumstances
* Crash just after opening the game
  * Occasional crashes just after opening are normal
  * Crash just after opening several times in a row This is not normal， issues
